This is my very first Python app. Its a Graphical User Inteface application.
It runs on any platform as long as Python is insalled. It was designed with tkinter which comes by default on Python.
This is an app which provides necessary interface for handling the data, save and retrieve them from a MySQL database
on my mysql.cc.puv.fi database server.
The database name, username and password has to be entered accurately to access the database
The options to handle data include modify, insert, delete, searching and displaying the data.
The database has to opened before any operation and close after operation.
The Order table date format has to be in the format "YYYY.mm.dd" and every table has to be serched,modified and delete using the table ID
Data handling in the Order table has to be done using the Customer_id which is the primary key.

Installation

download and install Python, pymsql and Pmw module.
Open source code and edit Database name, Username and Password

Enjoying handling data !
